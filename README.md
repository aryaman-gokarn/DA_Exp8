## Objective: 

Understanding Support Vector Machine algorithm through building SVM algorithm in Python 

## Introduction: 

An SVM is a numeric classifier. That means that all of the features of the data must be numeric, not symbolic. Furthermore, in this class, we'll assume that the SVM is a binary classifier: that is, it classifies points as one of two classifications. We'll typically call the classifications "+" and " -".  

A trained SVM is defined by two values:  
  • A normal vector w (also called the weight vector), which solely determines the shape and direction of the decision boundary.  
  • A scalar offset b, which solely determines the position of the decision boundary with respect to the origin.  
  
A trained SVM can then classify a point x by computing w · x + b. If this value is positive, x is classified as +; otherwise, x is classified as -.  

## Conclusion

We classify the dataset using Support Vector Machine using linear as well as non-linear kernels and successfully fulfilled all the objectives of the experiment.
